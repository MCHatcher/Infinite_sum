Vectorization of infinite sum in Matlab
This repository computes an infinite sum using vectorisation in Matlab: Leibniz formula for pi. Written by M. Hatcher (18/11/2024). Inspired by LinkedIn post of William Gatt (17/11/2024).
For comparison purposes, a code that uses a for loop is also provided. The speed difference of vectorization is apparent for high numbers of terms, J.
